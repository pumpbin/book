**PumpBin** is an Implant Generation Platform.

To use PumpBin, you need to have a b1n file or [create one](devs/start.md).
A b1n file contains one or more binary implant templates, along with some additional descriptive information. We refer to a b1n file as a Plugin.

- Powerful, simple, and comfortable UI
- Following the minimal principle to ensure maximum flexibility in usage
- Support two Plugin types: shellcode embedded in implants(Local) and hosted on remote servers(Remote)
- Support plugin development using any compiled language, such as C/C++, Rust, Zig, Go, etc
- Re-selecting the current plugin will generate a new random encryption password
- Filling with random data to ensure each generated implant is unique
- We have user manual, you no longer need to educate your users
- No dependencies, just PumpBin
- Support description, you can write down anything you want to remind users, which is important
- No network connection, eliminating any security concerns
